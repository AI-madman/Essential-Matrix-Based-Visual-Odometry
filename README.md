# Essential-Matrix-Based-Visual-Odometry

During the early stages of my PhD, I had made this Visual Odometry (VO) soloution to convert my theorical understanding of the Essental matrix [1] into a publishable soloution. During this process I found this blog post extreamly helpful [2].  Although I naver used it the blog post comes with a C++ implementation [3].

This project is setup to run on the KITTI dataset [4] but may be calibarted to run on other datasets.
